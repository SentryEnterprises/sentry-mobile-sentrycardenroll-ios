# Sentry Biometric Enroll and Verify üì±üè∑Ô∏è - Biometric fingerprint enrollment and verification
#### Backed with CoreNFC

## Aims
Provides a simplistic demonstration of enrolling a fingerprint onto a biometric card and verifying the enrolled fingerprint, and can be used as a reference application for developers to integrate such functionality into their applications.

## Version
Unreleased - 0.2

## Requirements
This is meant for use with the biometric Sentinel Wallet card from Sentry Enterprises, with the Enroll applet from IDEX installed on the card. This repository includes the installEnroll.jcsh script file (in the Scripts directory) that will reset the java card and install the Enroll applet. This script is meant for use with the JCShell available from IDEX. Expects the 'com.idex.enroll.cap' applet to be located at the path <current directory>/cap/com.idex.enroll.cap.


## Guide



###  IMPORTANT - ABOUT THE PIN
The installEnroll.jcsh script does not set a PIN on the card. If no PIN is set, the application sets the PIN to "1234" by default. This mobile app is compatible with any card that has the IDEX Enroll applet, which may have been installed with a different script that sets the PIN. If the install script used to initialize the card includes setting the PIN, this value MUST match the default PIN value. If the install script does not set the PIN, this application will set the PIN to the default value. If the application starts getting `0x63CX` errors when scanning the card, this indicates that the PINs do not match.
 
Users can set the PIN used by this application through the iPhone Settings application:

    1. Close the application (the application must be fully closed, not just in the background).
    2. Open Settings.
    3. Navigate to 'Sentry Enroll'.
    4. Enter the desired PIN in the `Sentry Enroll Settings` box.
 
The PIN MUST be 4-6 characters in length. Less than four (4) characters causes the app to throw an error. Any characters after the 6th are ignored.
